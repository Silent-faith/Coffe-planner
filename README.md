In this I build a UI for a **Coffee Planner** by which you can select your preferred coffee in a restaurant and could get it. 

### Refer to image below:

<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<img src="https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/coffee-planner-output-v2.gif" alt="coffee-planner-large-output" style="max-width:70%;box-shadow:0 2.8px 2.2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)">

</div>
<br/>
